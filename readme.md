# Metronisys Policies  
### Machine-Readable Governance for Autonomous AI

Metronisys™ Policies provide **YAML and JSON governance definitions** that enable autonomous AI systems to operate within **human-first boundaries**.

This repository contains the **enforcement layer** of the Metronisys framework — designed to be consumed programmatically by AI agents, automation platforms, and orchestration systems.

---

## Purpose

Autonomous AI systems need more than ethics statements and documentation.  
They need **enforceable rules**.

This repository provides:
- Machine-readable governance policies
- Decision boundaries for AI execution
- Human-first constraints on autonomy
- Inputs for certification and audit

These policies are intended to sit **above execution engines** such as:
- Agent frameworks (e.g. Moltbot)
- Automation platforms (e.g. UiPath)
- Orchestrators and schedulers

**Agents execute.  
Metronisys governs.**
